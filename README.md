# 🌊 LinuxWave Data

The package index that LinuxWave reads at runtime: where every package and
dependency comes from, its `sha256`, and what it depends on.

> **Site notice**: the official website has moved to **[linuxwave.org](https://linuxwave.org)** (previously `linuxwave.macwave.org`).

# 🌊 What is this repository?

LinuxWave itself lives in `LinuxWaveOrg/LinuxWave`. This repository carries
**data only** — the installer and `wave selfupdate` never read it, but
`wave install`, `wave search` and `wave info` do, and they read it live
(there is no local cache to refresh).

# 🌊 Layout

```
pkg/pkginfo_{arch}/{name}/_{name}@common             bin_name / des / hom / lic / aut
pkg/pkginfo_{arch}/{name}/_{name}@{version}          url / sha256 / deps

deps/depsinfo_{arch}/{name}/_{name}@common      dep_name / des / hom / lic / aut
deps/depsinfo_{arch}/{name}/_{name}@{version}   url / sha256 / deps
```

`{arch}` is `amd64` (linux-64) or `arm64` (linux-aarch64).

- `url` must be `https://`.
- `sha256` is verified before anything is extracted.
- `deps` lists one `name@version` per line, written as a quoted multi-line
  list. A package without a `deps` field has no dependencies.

# 🌊 Install LinuxWave

In the terminal, run:

```
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/LinuxWaveOrg/LinuxWave/HEAD/lib/install.sh)" && source ~/.zshrc
```

(If you are using bash instead of zsh, run `source ~/.bashrc`)

**Requirements: Python (3.14 and above), patchelf (for dependency library relocation).**
